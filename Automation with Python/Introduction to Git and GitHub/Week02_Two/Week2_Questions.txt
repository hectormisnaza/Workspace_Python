Pregunta
What is the purpose of the git checkout command?

* It finalizes staged changes.
* It reverts changes to modified files before they are staged.
* It skips staging and directly commits.

    Right on! git checkout restores files to the latest stored snapshot, reverting any changes before staging.

Pregunta
Which of the following is true about the git revert command?

* It undoes a commit as though it never happened.
* It creates a new commit with inverse changes.
* The output of git revert is not the same as a regular commit.
* It does not include the ID of the commit that was reverted.
Correcto
Awesome! With git revert, a new commit is created with inverse changes. This cancels previous changes instead of making it as though the original commit never happened.
