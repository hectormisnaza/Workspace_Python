Pregunta 1
If we want to see a specific commit, which command would we use along with the commit ID?

* git log --stat
* git show
* git log -p
* git commit -am
Correcto
    You nailed it! Taking the commit ID, git show will show information about the commit and its associated patch.

Pregunta 2
If we need to delete a file from our repository, we'll need to run a command to delete the file and then stage and commit the change. Which command would we use to delete the file?

* git rm
* git mv
* git diff
* git del
Correcto
    Woohoo! This command removes files from the working tree and from the index.

Pregunta
What is the purpose of the git checkout command?

* It finalizes staged changes.
* It reverts changes to modified files before they are staged.
* It skips staging and directly commits.
* It displays the current status of the commit.
Correcto
    Right on! git checkout restores files to the latest stored snapshot, reverting any changes before staging.

Pregunta
Which of the following is true about the git revert command?

* It undoes a commit as though it never happened.
* It creates a new commit with inverse changes.
* The output of git revert is not the same as a regular commit.
* It does not include the ID of the commit that was reverted.
Correcto
    Awesome! With git revert, a new commit is created with inverse changes. This cancels previous changes instead of making it as though the original commit never happened.

Pregunta
What is the purpose of organizing repositories into branches?

* To enable changes to be worked on without disrupting the most current working state.
* To make it easier to undo commits.
* To enable changes to the repository to permanently replace previous commits.
* To give users a place to keep notes.
Correcto
    Awesome! By creating a new branch, we can experiment without breaking what already works.

Pregunta
What does the git checkout -b new branch command do?

* Switches to another branch and immediately commits.
* Checks if the new branch is ahead of the main branch.
* Merges two branches.
* Creates a new branch and switches to it.
Correcto
    Nice job! It's very handy to be able to start a new branch, and switch to it in a single command.

Pregunta
What happens when we merge two branches?

* The HEAD points at the master branch.
* Both branches are pointed at the same commit.
* One of the former branches disappears.
* Two independent snapshots will now share the same name.
Correcto
    Awesome! Merging combines branched data and history together.
