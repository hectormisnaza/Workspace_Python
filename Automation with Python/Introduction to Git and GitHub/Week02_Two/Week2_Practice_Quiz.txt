Practice Quiz: Advanced Git Interaction

Pregunta 1
Which of the following commands is NOT an example of a method for comparing or reviewing the changes made to a file?

* git log -p
* git diff --staged
* git add -p
* git mv
Correcto
    Nice job! git mv won't give you any information on changes. Instead, it is used to move or rename a file or directory in Git.


Pregunta 2
What is the gitignore file?

* A file containing a list of commands that Git will ignore.
* A file the user is intended to ignore.
* A file listing uncommitted changes.
* A file containing a list of files or filename patterns for Git to skip for the current repo.
Correcto
    Awesome! The gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.


Pregunta 3
What kind of file will the command git commit -a not commit?

* Tracked files
* New files
* Old files
* Staged files
Correcto
    Right on! Files that are new and untracked will not be committed before being added.

Pregunta 4
What does HEAD represent in Git?

* The subject line of a commit message
* The top portion of a commit
* The currently checked-out snapshot of your project
* The first commit of your project
Correcto
    Great work! In all cases, HEAD is used to indicate what the currently checked-out snapshot is.

Pregunta 5
If we want to show some stats about the changes in a commit, like which files were changed and how many lines were added or removed, what flag should we add to git log?

*  --stat
*  --patch
*  -2
*  --pretty
Correcto
    Excellent! This will cause git log to show some stats about the changes in the commit, like which files were changed and how many lines were added or removed.


Practice Quiz: Undoing Things

Pregunta 1
Let's say we've made a mistake in our latest commit to a public branch. Which of the following commands is the best option for fixing our mistake?

* git revert
* git commit --amend
* git reset
* git checkout -- <file>
Correcto
    Nice job! git revert will create a new commit to reverse the previous one, and is the best option for undoing commits on public branches.

Pregunta 2
If we want to rollback a commit on a public branch that wasn't the most recent one using the revert command, what must we do?

* Use the git reset HEAD~2 command instead of revert
* Use the revert command repeatedly until we've reached the one we want
* use the commit ID at the end of the git revert command
* Use the git commit --amend command instead
Correcto
    Nice work! The commit ID is a 40-character hash that identifies each commit.

Pregunta 3
What does Git use cryptographic hash keys for?

* To secure project backups
* To guarantee the consistency of our repository
* To encrypt passwords
* To identify commits
Correcto
    Woohoo! Git doesn't really use these hashes for security. Instead, they’re used to guarantee the consistency of our repository.

Pregunta 4
What does the command git commit --amend do?

* Start a new branch
* Create a copy of the previous commit
* Delete the previous commit
* Overwrite the previous commit
Correcto
    Awesome! The command git commit --amend will overwrite the previous commit with what is already in the staging area.

Pregunta 5
How can we easily view the log message and diff output the last commit if we don't know the commit ID?

* git show
* git identify
* git log
* git revert
Correcto
    Right on! The git show command without an object parameter specified  will default to show us information about the commit pointed to by the HEAD.
